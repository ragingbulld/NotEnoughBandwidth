## Introduction

NEB uses various methods to save as much network traffic as possible during Minecraft gameplay, while remaining transparent to both mods and players.

In the TeaCon Jiachen dataset, compared to raw uncompressed data, NEB can theoretically reduce the server's outbound traffic to **7.6%** of its original size. For comparison, the outbound traffic of Vanilla's default compression mechanism is 39% of the original data size.

In tests conducted in a Vanilla environment, the server outbound traffic was reduced to **18%** of its original size. As the number of installed mods increases, compression performance improves.

Press **N** in-game to view the network traffic status.

## Main Features

### Compact Packet Header

Optimizes `CustomPacketPayload` encoding and decoding by replacing the packet header `Identifier` (Packet Type) with a compact VarInt index. This reduces the mod network packet header overhead to a fixed 3-4 bytes, instead of the length of the string corresponding to the network packet type.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Fixed 8 bits header
> ```
> +------------- 1 byte (8 bits) ---------------+
> |               function flags                 |
> +---+---+--------------------------------------+
> | i | t |      reserved (6 bits)               |
> +---+---+--------------------------------------+
> ```
> - i = indexed (1 bit)
> - t = tight_indexed (1 bit, only valid if i=1)
> - reserved = 6 bits (for future use)
>
> ### Indexed packet type
> - If i=0 (not indexed): full `Identifier` in UTF-8 follows.
> - If i=1 and t=0 (indexed, NOT tight): 3 bytes — 12-bit namespace-id + 12-bit path-id (capacity 4096 each).
> - If i=1 and t=1 (indexed, tight): 2 bytes — 8-bit namespace-id + 8-bit path-id (capacity 256 each).

### Aggregation and Compression

Optimizes the situation where vanilla often produces a large number of small network packets. Intercepts transmission at the `Connection` level, assembles them into one large network packet every 20ms, and sends it after Zstd compression.

> +---+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----...
>           +--packet 1---++--packet 2---+
>           +---------compressed---------+
> ```
> - B = bool, whether compressed
> - S = varint, size of uncompressed data (only present if compressed)
> - p = prefix (medium/int/utf-8), type of this subpacket
> - s = varint, size of this subpacket
> - d = bytes, data of this subpacket

### Delayed Chunk Cache (DCC)

In Vanilla, when a player moves, the server instructs the client to immediately forget the chunks behind them; if the player returns to the original position, the full chunk data must be sent again. By delaying this "forgetting", the chunk transmission traffic generated when moving back and forth can be saved.

### Persistent Chunk Cache (PCC)

Caches chunk data persistently on the client side using a local LevelDB database, keyed by a 64-bit content hash. On each connection, the client sends a Bloom Filter of all cached chunk hashes to the server. When the server is about to send a chunk whose hash is in the filter, it sends only the 20-byte hash instead of the full packet (~10–20 KB). The client loads the chunk from its local database. On a Bloom Filter false positive, the client requests the full data as a fallback. The Bloom Filter is refreshed every 64 newly cached chunks so the optimization takes effect within the same session.

## Configuration

Modify the configuration file at `config/NotEnoughBandwidthConfig.json`.

### compatibleMode

> **Works independently on client and server.**

Whether to enable compatibility mode. If set to `true`, the `blackList` below will be used.
Default is `true`.

### blackList

> **Works independently on client and server.**

The blacklist for compatibility mode. Packets listed here will be skipped by NEB. You can add packets as needed.

> [!WARNING]
> To ensure packet ordering, packets in the blacklist will interrupt the ongoing aggregation. If there are many packets in the blacklist, or if the corresponding packets are sent too frequently, the efficiency of aggregation-compression will decrease.

### requireClientMod

> **Server only.**

Whether the server should require the NEB client mod. Default is `true`. When enabled, the server disconnects clients that do not send the `NebAck` handshake instead of falling back to vanilla behavior.

### aggregationFlushPeriodMs, aggregationMaxExtraCycles

> **Works independently on client and server.**

Aggregation flush period and the number of extra cycles allowed while waiting for a larger batch. Defaults are `5` ms and `0`.

With the new defaults, low-traffic batches wait for at most about `5` ms instead of the previous `60` ms worst case.

### compressionLevel

> **Works independently on client and server.**

The Zstd compression level (integer 1-19). Default is 6. Higher values produce better compression but use more CPU.

### contextLevel

> **Works independently on client and server.**

The Zstd context window size (integer 21-25, representing 2-32MB). Default is 23 (8MB). Larger values result in better compression but consume more memory.

> [!TIP]
> For a server with 100 players, a setting of 25 will result in approximately 3200MB of additional memory usage.

### dccSizeLimit, dccDistance, dccTimeout

> **Server only.**

Delayed Chunk Cache (DCC) parameters: max cached chunks, cache distance, cache timeout (seconds). Larger values may consume more memory, while smaller values may trigger updates more frequently.

### chunkCacheEnabled

> **Client only.**

Whether to enable the Persistent Chunk Cache. Default is `true`.

### chunkCacheMaxSizeMB

> **Client only.**

Maximum size of the local chunk cache database in megabytes. Default is `2048` (2 GB).

## Installation

Requires:
- Minecraft 1.21.4
- Fabric Loader >= 0.18.0
- Fabric API

**Both client and server must install NEB.** With the default configuration, clients without NEB are disconnected. Set `requireClientMod` to `false` if you want the server to fall back to vanilla behavior for those connections.
